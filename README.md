# XMLDialogueHandler
Custom XML Reader built for handling dialogue in future game projects

## Example Game Instructions
I can't be bothered to make it easy for you so you're gonna run the source code, babey

- Requires .NET Core 3.1 SDK or newer
- Open a cmd window at the filepath where you placed the folder
 - e.g. `cd C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\XMLDialogueHandler`
- Use the `dotnet run` command to build Program.cs

- Pay close attention.

## To Do:
- ~~Dynamic dialogue readout (currently can only properly read out dialogue in consecutive order)~~
- ~~Generate large amounts of formatted XML to test current solution~~
    - ~~id increases linearly~~
    - ~~Iterate through dialogue objects by id~~
    - ~~Check time required to find each object~~

- More robust id system to account for branching dialogue
- [SCRAPPED] ~~Use XMLDocument to load .xml so program isn't reading through every fucking fjl;askdfj;lasdjdflp;asdknf dialogue object~~
