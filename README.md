# XMLDialogueHandler
Custom XML Reader built for handling dialogue in future game projects

## To Do:
- ~~Dynamic dialogue readout (currently can only properly read out dialogue in consecutive order)~~
- ~~Generate large amounts of formatted XML to test current solution~~
    - ~~id increases linearly~~
    - ~~Iterate through dialogue objects by id~~
    - ~~Check time required to find each object~~

- More robust id system to account for branching dialogue
- Use XMLDocument to load .xml so program isn't reading through every fucking fjl;askdfj;lasdjdflp;asdknf <dialogue> object
