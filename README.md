# XMLDialogueHandler
Custom XML Reader built for handling dialogue in future game projects

## To Do:
- ~~Dynamic dialogue readout (currently can only properly read out dialogue in consecutive order)~~
- More robust id system to account for branching dialogue

- Generate large amounts of formatted XML to test current solution
    - Strings of formatted dialogue objects with random strings included within tags
    - id increases linearly
    - Iterate through dialogue objects by id
    - Check time required to find each object
